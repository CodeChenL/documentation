# Installing ROOBI OS

ROOBI OS

:::tip

ROOBI OS will come pre-installed on the machine you purchased, so you usually don't need to install it manually.

:::

## Using ROOBI Flasher

ROOBI Flasher is a flashing tool used to recover ROOBI OS. If your ROOBI system fails to start due to uncontrollable factors, you can use this tutorial to restore your ROOBI system to its factory state.

:::note

**ROOBI OS** is the software that runs on the device for flashing the operating system, while **ROOBI Flasher** is the software used to flash ROOBI OS.

**ROOBI OS** cannot be directly run from a USB flash drive.

:::

1. Obtain the flashing image:

   >

2. Insert the USB flash drive into your host machine.
