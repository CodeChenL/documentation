# PXE Usage Guide

- PXE stands for Preboot Execute Environment, referring to the capability to boot the system via network.

** A PXE server is required within the local network to provide services. Radxa X2L can then install and boot various systems through the PXE server (setting up a PXE server is not covered in this document).**

## PXE Function Configuration

- Power on the system and press the DEL key to access the BIOS settings.
- Navigate to Advanced --> Network Stack Configuration.
- Enable the relevant PXE options (taking IPV4 network PXE server as an example) as shown in the figure below. After configuration, press F4 to save and exit.
