# Getting Started

The Radxa X series is a newly launched single-board computer series by Radxa, based on the X86 platform.

:::warning
The Radxa X2L doesn't come with a CMOS battery. For the first time power on, the BIOS initializes hardware setting, the red light is on. This will last about 1 minute then X2L will reboot, and the white light is on, and the BIOS boots normally. Without CMOS battery(Type: CR1220), the above will repeat.
