# U-boot

## Environment Configuration

BSP is a set of tools provided by Radxa to quickly build U-Boot Kernel. It is very convenient to use bsp to build your own U-Boot and Kernel.  
The following will show you how to use bsp to build the U-Boot of Radxa NX5 IO.

[bsp Environment configuration](https://radxa-repo.github.io/bsp/)

## Build U-Boot

After completing the bsp environment configuration, you need to compile U-Boot once before pulling the relevant code from the repository.  
you can execute `. /bsp u-boot rknext radxa-nx5-io` to build U-Boot, the path to the U-Boot source code is located in the bsp directory under `.src/u-boot`.

```shell
cd bsp
mkdir output
cd output
../bsp --no-prepare-source u-boot rknext radxa-nx5-io

Parameter Description:
--no-prepare-source
#Compile with local changes, if you don't add this parameter it will sync the
#latest code from the Radxa U-Boot repository and overwrite the local changes.
```

For more bsp parameter usage instructions, you can execute `./bsp` to view.

After compilation, many `deb` packages will be generated in the bsp/output directory, you just need to install the following `deb` packages.

```shell
u-boot-rknext_2017.09-1_arm64.deb
```

Copy the above `deb` packages to the board and install them with the `dpkg` command to complete the U-Boot file update.

```shell
sudo dpkg -i u-boot-rknext_2017.09-1_arm64.deb
```

U-Boot needs to be flashed onto the boot media after the 'dpkg -i' is complete.

```shell
cd /usr/lib/u-boot/radxa-nx5-io/
sudo ./setup.sh update_bootloader /dev/mmcblk1   #/dev/mmcblk1 is the boot media you are currently using, you need to select it according to the actual device you are using
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, you can observe the U-Boot boot log to see if U-Boot has been successfully updated.
