# HDMI

HDMI (High‑Definition Multimedia Interface) is a unified method of transferring video and audio data over a TMDS (Transition Minimized Differential Signaling) compatible physical link to an audio/visual display device. The HDMI interface is electrically compatible with the DVI (Digital Visual Interface) standard.

Features꞉

- HPD (Hot Plug Detect) input analog comparator
- Input reference clock range of 13.5–600MHz
- Support for up to 10 bits Deep Color modes
- Aggregate bandwidth of up to 18Gbps
- Support for video resolutions up to 1080p@120Hz and 4096x2304@60Hz
- Compatibility with 3‑D video formats

|  Signal  | Impedance  |  Description  |
|----------|------------|---------------|
|HDMI_TX_DP/DN[2꞉0] | 100ohm±10% | HDMI TX data transmission   |
|HDMI_TX_CLKP/CLKN  | 100ohm±10% | HDMI TX clock transmission  |
|HDMI_TX_HPDIN      |Not specified | HDMI TX hot‑plug detection|
|HDMI_TX_REXT       |Not specified |External resistor for HDMI reference connection(Default꞉ 1% precision 1.62k resistor)  |
|HDMITX_SCL/SDA     |Not specified |HDMI data communication channel  |
|HDMITX_CEC         |Not specified |HDMI Consumer Electronics Control pin  |

On the RADXA CM3 compute module, the HDMITX_SCL/SDA and HDMITX_CEC signals have already been processed through level translation. The HDMI_TX_HPDIN signal has a 100k ohm pull‑down resistor and is series‑connected to the RK3566 through a 1k ohm resistor. When designing a baseboard, users don’t need to worry about the level translation issue. Please refer to the following design꞉
