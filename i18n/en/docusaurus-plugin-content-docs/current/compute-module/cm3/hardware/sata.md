# SATA

SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) is a serial communication hard disk interface supported by RK3566. It adheres to the SATA V3.0 protocol and offers the following features꞉

- Compatibility with Gen1 / Gen2 / Gen3 standards.
- Support for a maximum signal transmission rate of 6GT/s on a single data channel.
- Support for Out‑of‑Band (OOB) communication.
- Support for SATA Power Management (PM) function and connection with external expansion chips.
- Support for spread spectrum function.

The table below provides the impedance and description of the SATA interface signals꞉  

|Signal | Impedance | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
|SATAx_TXP/N | 90ohm±10% | SATA data send, place the coupling capacitor 10nF close to the mainboard connector |
|SATAx_RXP/N | 90ohm±10% | SATA data receive, place the coupling capacitor 10nF close to the mainboard connector |

The following layout requirements should be considered for SATA 3.0꞉ 

|Parameter | Requirement  |
|----------|-------------|
|Trace Impedance | 100Ω ±10% differential |
|Max intra‑pair skew | <12mil |
|Max trace length on carrier board | <6 inches |
|AC coupling capacitors  |  10nF ±20%, discrete 0201 package preferable |
|Minimum pair‑to‑pair spacing | ≥4 times the width of SATA trace |
|Minimum spacing between SATA and other signals | ≥4 times the width of SATA trace  |
|Maximum allowed via |  Recommend ≤ 2 vias |
