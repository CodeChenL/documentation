<summary>Maskrom Mode</summary>

The OTG interface of ROCK 3A is located on the upper USB 3.0 port, and can be used to communicate with the host computer and the board in Maskrom via the USB-A to USB-A cable.
In Maskrom mode, you can use [Rockchip Development Kit](/general-tutorial/rksdk) to operate your product.

The following are the steps for the ROCK 3A to enter Maskrom mode:

1. Shutdown and disconnect the power supply.
2. Connect the Maskrom pin, which is located next to the 40 pin GPIO connector.
3. Plug in the power cable and power up, if the power green light is always on, then the ROCK 3A has successfully entered the Maskrom mode.
4. Connect the OTG port of the board to the USB port of the host PC via the USB-A to USB-A cable to achieve communication.
