## Overview

Radxa Display 8 HD is a color active matrix LCD module with touch panel designed specifically for Radxa Single Board Computers. This 8.0 inch display lets you create interactive projects such as tablets, industrial HMI, information dashboards and so on. With a sinlge cable for power, display and touch, and enabled software on‑screen keyboard, the Radxa Display 8 HD gives you full human computer interface without the need to connect a keyboard or mouse. Additionally, a built‑in gensor on the display can be used for automatically potrail or landscape rotation. It has the following features:  
・ 8.0 inch LCD  
・ 800 x 1280, 16.7M colors resolution  
・ Full angle viewing LCD  
・ 5‑Point capacitive touch panel  
・ Support PWM brightness control  
・ Support Color enhancement  
・ Built‑in g‑sensor for potrail/landscape rotation

## Touch

The Radxa Display 8 HD touch panel is powered by GT911, a new‑generation 5‑point capacitive touch solution designed for 7” to 8” panels, consists of up to 26 transmitter electrodes and 14 receiver electrodes to provide higher touch accuracy. GT911 supports up to 5 concurrent touches with real‑time tracking of accurate position and motion trajectory as well as touch area. Furthermore, it is able to report such information to the host as required.
