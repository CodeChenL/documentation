4. Enable 25W PoE Overlay

If you need to enable the temperature control fan and temperature sensor, you need to enable the corresponding Overlay.

Please refer to [Device Tree Configuration](/radxa-os/rsetup/devicetree#how-to-enable-an-overlay) to enable the overlay named "Enable Radxa 25W PoE HAT".

```bash.
  [*] Enable Radxa 25W PoE HAT
```

Finally, reboot the device to load the Overlay.

:::info
If you cannot find the corresponding Overlay in `rsetup`, please refer to [System Update Guide](/radxa-os/rsetup#system-update) to first perform a system update and then perform the above.

5. Checking Temperature Sensor Readings

After executing the following command, the second line outputs `t=XXYYYY` which is the current temperature (XX.YYY degrees Celsius):

```bash
cat /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-*/w1_slave
```
