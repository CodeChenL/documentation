# Radxa 23W PoE

Radxa 23W PoE HAT is a HAT accessory designed for Raspberry Pi, Radxa ROCK 3 and 4 series, and Jetson Nano.  
The 23W PoE HAT allows you to power your Raspberry Pi, ROCK 3 and 4 series or Jetson Nano using Power over Ethernetâ€“enabled networks; 
for this product to be used, the network it is connected to needs to have power-sourcing equipment installed.

## Supported Products

|Model|Supported Products|
|:-:|-|
|F3|Raspberry Pi 3B+, Raspberry Pi 4, ROCK Pi X, ROCK 3A, ROCK 3C, ROCK 4C+, Jetson Nano|
|F3L|F3 with 40PIN GPIO pass-through exported|
|F4|ROCK Pi 4A / 4B / 4A+ / 4B+ / 4SE|
|F4L|F4 with 40PIN GPIO pass-through exported|

The difference between F3 and F4 are:  
F3 and F4 use different GPIO for fan control. F4 uses ADC for temperature detection, while F3 uses DS18B20.  
F3 and F4 use different PoE pins. As the picture following:

The difference between Fx and FxL:  
FxL has the 40 pins GPIO pin-out, you can also use the 40 pins GPIO, but you can't while using Fx. As the picture following:  
![Fx and FxL](/img/accessories/poe-hat/23w-poe-l.webp)

## Features

- 802.3at up to 23W(5V/4.6A)
- PWM control FAN up to 12000RPM
- Temperature sensor DS18B20
- Optional 40PIN GPIO pass-through exported
- Compatible with Radxa ROCK, Raspberry Pi 3B+ and Raspberry Pi 4
- Clean design by hiding the fan and the big transformer inside
- EEPROM for HAT identity and driver probe

## Necessary Accessories

An Ethernet cable  
Power-sourcing equipment for an 802.3af or 802.3at Power over Ethernet network

## Fan Control

We provide an install script to help you get the PoE fan control tool that works both in Raspberry Pi 3B+/4B and ROCK 4 series.  
Run the following command to get the script:

```bash
curl -sL https://rock.sh/get-rockpi-poe | sudo -E bash -
```

Turn the fan on or off by systemctl:

```bash
sudo systemctl start rockpi-poe.service
sudo systemctl stop rockpi-poe.service
```

Edit `/etc/rockpi-poe.conf` to set up the temperature of the fan speed level, take it to effect by below command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart rockpi-poe.service
```

## Manual installation

If you have trouble installing software using our script, try the manual installation.

1. Enable hardware resources

For speed control and temperature detection, we need to ensure that some hardware resources are available, such as PWM and ADC. Since ROCK Pi and Raspberry Pi use different resources, they will be explained below.

1.1 ROCK Pi

If you are using the official system, please edit /boot/hw_intfc.conf to change intfc:pwm0=off and intfc:pwm1=off into intfc:pwm0=on and intfc:pwm1=on. If you are using another system, please refer to the distribution documentation to open PWM0 and PWM1.

1.2 Raspberry Pi

If you are using Raspbian, you can open 1-Wire with raspi-config and the path is Interfacing Options -> 1-Wire. Raspbian turns on PWM1 by default. If you are using another system, please refer to the distribution documentation to open 1-Wire and PWM1.

2. Install GPIO control library

2.1 ROCKP Pi

If you are using the official system, please install libmraa-rockpi4 from testing repo of Radxa APT. If you are using another system, please download mraa and build.

2.2 ROCKP Pi

If you are using Raspbian, you can install python3-rpi.gpio via apt. If you are using another system, please download raspberry-gpio-python and build.

3. Download package and install

3.1 ROCK Pi

```bash
wget https://cos.setq.me/rockpi/deb/rockpi-poe-0.13.deb
```

If you are using a debian based system, you can install it through dpkg. If you are using another system, extract the file to the root directory.

3.2 Raspberry Pi

```bash
wget https://cos.setq.me/rockpi/deb/raspi-poe-0.13.deb
```

If you are using a debian based system, you can install it through dpkg. If you are using another system, extract the file to the root directory.

4. Enable service

```bash
   sudo systemctl enable rockpi-poe.service
```

That's all the installation script (https://rock.sh/get-rockpi-poe) do.
