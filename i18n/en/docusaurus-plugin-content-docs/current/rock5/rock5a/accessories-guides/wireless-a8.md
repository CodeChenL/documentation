**Note: It is best to turn off the power during installation.**

## Configuration

- After starting the computer, open the terminal "Ctrl+Alt+T" to check whether the wireless module A8 is recognized, enter the following command and press the Enter key:
```bash
ip addr show
```
This will display information about all the network interfaces in your system.


- Look for the wireless card: In the command output, look for lines starting with "wlan." These indicate that a wireless card has been recognized as a network interface.  
  For example, you might see a line like this:

```bash
wlan0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
```
Here, "wlan0" is the interface name of the wireless card.

If you see the interface name of the wireless card, it means that it has been successfully recognized. You can use this interface name for further configuration and management of the wireless network connection. If you don't see the interface name of the wireless card, you may need to ensure that the wireless module is properly inserted and the drivers are correctly installed.
