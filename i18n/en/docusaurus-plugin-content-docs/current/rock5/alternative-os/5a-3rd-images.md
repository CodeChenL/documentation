# ROCK 5A Third-party Image

In addition to the official images, ROCK 5A also supports many third-party images.

You can view and download them at [ROCK 5 series download page](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock5/downloads).

:::caution
Most of the third-party images have not been extensively tested, so some problems may occur during use.

You can report your issues at [Radxa Forum](https://forum.radxa.com/).

## Community compiled images

In addition to the regular images, the developers from [Radxa Forum](https://forum.radxa.com/) have ported some unique images for the ROCK 5 series.

The [ROCK 5 download screen](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock5/downloads) already has information on the compiled images.

## Installation

Usually, third-party images are installed in the same way as official images. If there is a difference, it is specifically noted on the [Image download page](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock5/downloads).

The image download page usually gives a link to the installation instructions.
