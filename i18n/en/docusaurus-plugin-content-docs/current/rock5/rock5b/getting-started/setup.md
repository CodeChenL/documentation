- USB interface

ROCK 5B offers two USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0 ports. You can choose mouse or keyboard as input device.  

- Ethernet port
If you are using the wired Ethernet port, please align the network cable with the RJ45 port on the ROCK 5B and insert it, and the wired connection will pop up on the system desktop.

- HDMI
The ROCK 5B has two HDMI output ports (**Type A**), both support CEC and HDMI 2.1 with resolutions of 8Kp60 and 4Kp60 respectively.   
In addition，the ROCK 5B has one HDMI input port (**Type D**), which support HDMI 2.1 input with resolutions of 4Kp60.     
**Note: Before use, please confirm whether the HDMI cable interface specification is Type A or Type C. ** 

- Headphone interface
ROCK 5B offers a headphone and you can connect the headphone to the headphone port in ROCK 5B as shown in the picture.

- USB Power  
The power interface specification of RACK 5B is Type-C interface. Radxa recommends using [Radxa Power 30W](https://docs.radxa.com/accessories/pd_30w) to ensure that the device can work properly.    

- M.2 interface  
ROCK 5B offers two M.2 connectors:
  - On the front site of the board there is a M.2 E Key connector with 2230 mounting hole providing PCIe 2.1 one‑lane, USB, SATA, SDIO, PCM and UART signal, supporting industrial standard M.2 WiFi 6 modules.   
If you want to surf the Internet through the wireless module, Radxa recommends you to use [Radxa Wireless A8](https://docs.radxa.com/accessories/wireless-a8). The interface specification of Radxa Wireless A8 is M.2 2230 E key. Install it on the M.2 E port of ROCK 5B and then set up the wifi network to access the Internet. For details, please refer to [Network Settings](https://docs.radxa.com/radxa-os/network).
  
  - On the back site of the board there is a M.2 M Key connector with four‑lane PCIe 3.0 interface. A standard M.2 2280 mounting hole is on the board to enable the deployment of a M.2 2280 NVMe SSD.
