## Connect wireless module with M.2 E key interface  
If you want to surf the Internet through the wireless module, Radxa recommends you to use [Radxa Wireless A8](https://docs.radxa.com/accessories/wireless-a8). The interface specification of Radxa Wireless A8 is M.2 2230 E key. Install it on the M.2 E port of ROCK 5B and then set up the wifi network to access the Internet. For details, please refer to [Network Settings](https://docs.radxa.com/radxa-os/network).

## M.2 interface
ROCK 5B offers two M.2 connectors:
- On the front site of the board there is a M.2 E Key connector with 2230 mounting hole providing PCIe 2.1 one‑lane, USB, SATA, SDIO, PCM and UART signal, supporting industrial standard M.2 WiFi 6 modules. 
- On the back site of the board there is a M.2 M Key connector with four‑lane PCIe 3.0 interface. A standard M.2 2280 mounting hole is on the board to enable the deployment of a M.2 2280 NVMe SSD.   
**Please note that M.2 SATA SSDs are not supported.**  

## Headphone interface
ROCK 5B offers a headphone and you can connect the headphone to the headphone port in ROCK 5B as shown in the picture.
