In order to maximize the performance of Radxa ZERO2, it is specially equipped with a customized cooling module. The heat dissipation module is made of aluminum and designed with a multi-fin structure, which effectively increases the heat dissipation surface area. In addition, it is also equipped with a programmable cooling fan, which can dynamically adjust the speed according to the current load and temperature requirements of the device, so as to avoid unnecessary energy consumption and improve energy efficiency, thereby reducing power consumption and heat generation. This enables Radxa ZERO2 to maintain stable performance under high load conditions and provide an excellent user experience.
