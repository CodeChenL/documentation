## Configure Pins 8 and 10 as GPIOs

:::tip
By default, the UART2_M0 interface is a FIQ debugging serial port, which can output logs of DDR Init, U-Boot, Linux Kernel, etc. for debugging. Therefore, it is not recommended to cancel this configuration as you can use other serial ports if not necessary.
:::

## Disable the FIQ-Debugger configuration.

```bash
rsetup

# Follow these options to access the Manage overlays interface
# Overlays -> Manage overlays
```

Tick `Disable FIQ Debugger.`

Check the box and select OK, then exit rsetup and reboot the system, PIN 8 && PIN 10 can be used as normal GPIOs.
