### Install 3rd party overlay

Device Tree Overlays make it possible to support many hardware configurations with a single kernel and without the need to explicitly load or blacklist kernel modules.

You can use `rsetup` to manage overlays.

:::info
The Install 3rd party overlay feature of rsetup installs both device tree overlay files (DTBO) and source code (DTS).

Pre-compiled files from the official DTBO repository radxa/overlays can be downloaded [from here](https://github.com/radxa/overlays/actions).
:::

#### Get radxa/overlays source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radxa/overlays.git
cd overlays
```

#### Load the overlay using rsetup

Select `Overlays` in `rsetup`'s main interface:

```
Configure Device Tree Overlay
        Manage overlays
        View overlay info
        Install 3rd party overlay"
        Reset overlays
        <Ok>             <Cancel>
```

Then, select `Install 3rd party overlay`:

```
Configure Device Tree Overlay
        Manage overlays
        View overlay info
        Install 3rd party overlay
        Reset overlays


      <Ok>            <Cancel>
```

:::info
The following is the path to the source code of the Rexchip SOC device tree overlay file.

arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/overlays/\*.dts

If the SOC vendor is Amlogic, you need to replace rockchip with amlogic in the above path.
:::

Then select the overlay you want to load, then exit rsetup, and finally reboot.

:::tip
You can check the parameters using cat /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf
