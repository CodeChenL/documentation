### microSD Card

microSD is a small flash memory storage card typically used to expand the storage space of devices such as smartphones, tablets, and digital cameras. microSD cards come in a range of capacities from a few hundred megabytes to several tens of gigabytes, with relatively slow read/write speeds. However, they are compact, portable, and can easily transfer data between different devices.

### eMMC

eMMC is a built-in storage chip typically used in mobile devices and embedded systems. It integrates flash memory and a controller and has a relatively small capacity, usually ranging from 4GB to 128GB. eMMC has slower read/write speeds compared to SSD and is suitable for storing small applications, media, files and other data. The eMMC chip is often directly soldered onto the device motherboard, unlike Micro SD cards, which can be inserted and replaced.

Radxa offers **removable** eMMC modules.

### NVMe SSD

SSD is a solid-state drive that uses flash memory chips as its storage medium. Compared to traditional mechanical hard drives, it has faster read/write speeds, higher durability, and does not fail due to mechanical wear. SSDs typically range in capacity from 128GB to 2TB and can be used in personal computers, servers, workstations, and other fields.

## Suggestions For Selection

### eMMC

If you need the lowest possible power consumption and have low requirements for removability and disk performance, it is recommended to choose eMMC as the system disk.

### microSDcard

microSD cards have the advantage of low price and excellent cross-platform file exchange, and are recommended if you need to transfer files between platforms frequently.

### NVMe SSD

SSDs offer excellent performance, but are more expensive and consume more power, so they are recommended for high performance and stable power supplies.
