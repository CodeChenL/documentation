This tutorial applies to all official images of Radxa products.
There are two main methods of installing the operating system

1. Burning the system image to a microSD card, eMMC Module or SSD via an reader. (**Recommended**)
2. Burning the system image directly to eMMC, Nand Flash via USB cable.

## Method I

<Tabs queryString="target">

  <TabItem value="microSD" label="microSD">

### Preparations

- Prepare a microSD card
- Prepare a microSD card reader
- Download [corresponding product](/productlist) of the official system image
- Insert the microSD card into the microSD card reader and plug it into the USB port of the computer

### Writing OS image to microSD card

  <TabItem value="emmc-module" label="eMMC Module">

### Preparations

:::caution Notice
This tutorial is only applicable to write removable eMMC modules, onboard eMMCs need to be flashed using rkdevtool.
:::

- Prepare an eMMC module and a [Radxa eMMC reader](/accessories/emmc_reader)

![Radxa eMMC](/img/accessories/emmc_related_01.webp)

- Download [corresponding product](/productlist) of the official system image

- Install the eMMC module into the Radxa eMMC USB reader and plug it into the USB port of the computer

:::caution Notice
When installing eMMC module, point the notched edges outwards, align them with their seats and press to tighten.

### Writing OS image to EMMC Module

<Etcher model={props.model} />

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="nvme-ssd" label="NVMe SSD">

### Preparation

- A Radxa products that support NVMe SSD
- Suitable power adapter
- M.2 NVMe SSD
- **NVMe to USB 3.0 reader**
- Download [corresponding product](/productlist) of the official system image
- Insert the NVMe SSD into the NVMe SSD to USB 3.0 reader and plug it into the USB port of the computer

### Writing OS images to M.2 NVMe SSD

<Etcher model={props.model} />

Done! You have now successfully installed the OS image on your M.2 NVMe SSD.

#### Erase M.2 NVMe SSDs

If the M.2 NVMe SSD was previously burned with an Android (or Linux) image,
it is recommended that you erase the M.2 NVMe SSD before re-burning and then write the target image.

#### Boot from NVMe SSD

After writing the image to the NVMe SSD, to boot from the NVMe SSD you need to write the bootloader to the SPI Flash.

{/* For more information, please check [Installing the bootloader to SPI Flash]/general-tutorial/rksdk/rkdevtool for details. */}

## Method II

If your device uses a Rockchip chip, refer to the following tutorial:

### My computer is Windows

#### rkdevtool

<Rkdevtool />

### My computer is Linux / macOS

#### Rkdeveloptool
