## Using bsp

BSP is a set of tools provided by Radxa to quickly build U-Boot Kernel. It is very convenient to use bsp to build your own U-Boot and Kernel.
The following will show you how to use bsp to build the U-Boot of Radxa ZERO 3.

### [bsp Environment configuration](https://radxa-repo.github.io/bsp/)

After completing the bsp environment configuration, you need to compile U-Boot once before pulling the relevant code from the repository.
you can execute `. /bsp u-boot latest radxa-zero3` to build U-Boot, the path to the U-Boot source code is located in the bsp directory under `.src/u-boot`.

```
cd bsp
mkdir output
cd output
../bsp --no-prepare-source u-boot latest radxa-zero3

Parameter Description:
--no-prepare-source

#Compile with local changes, if you don't add this parameter it will sync the latest code from the Radxa U-Boot repository and overwrite the local changes.
```

For more bsp parameter usage instructions, you can execute `./bsp` to view.

After compilation, many `deb` packages will be generated in the bsp/output directory, you just need to install the following `deb` packages.

```
u-boot-latest_2023.10-1_arm64.deb
```

Copy the above two `deb` packages to the board and install them with the `dpkg` command to complete the U-Boot installation.

```
sudo dpkg -i u-boot-latest_2023.10-1_arm64.deb
```

U-Boot needs to be flashed onto the boot media after the installation is complete.

```
cd /usr/lib/u-boot/radxa-zero3/
sudo ./setup.sh update_bootloader /dev/mmcblk1   #/dev/mmcblk1 is the boot media you are currently using, you need to select it according to the actual device you are using
sudo reboot
```

After reboot, you can observe the U-Boot boot log to see if U-Boot has been successfully updated.

## Manual compilation

:::tip
`bsp` is the only compilation method that is currently supported, and it makes additional changes to the source code during the build.
If you want to develop based on our official releases, you should at least use `bsp` to download and configure the source code.

If you want to use a custom `make` command to compile, please refer to the [Prepare working tree](https://radxa-repo.github.io/bsp/dev_flow.html#prepare-working-tree) section to prepare the code.
