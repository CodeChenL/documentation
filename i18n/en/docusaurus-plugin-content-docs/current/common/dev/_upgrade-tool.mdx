## Usage for upgrade_tool

<Tabs queryString="mode">
<TabItem value="cli" label="Command Line Mode">

upgrade_tool is used in command line mode similar to rkdeveloptool.

:::tip
In command line mode, upgrade_tool does not support the selection of a Maskrom device, nor can it select the storage media to be written to.

If you need to select a specific one from multiple devices, use interactive mode.
:::

### View connected Maskrom devices

```bash
./upgrade_tool ld
```

### Write file

:::tip
upgrade_tool does not automatically decompress compressed files when writing to them.

First extract the used files and specify the extracted files in upgrade_tool.
:::

```bash
sudo ./upgrade_tool db <loader>
sudo ./upgrade_tool wl 0 <image>
```

Download links for the required Loader and Image files can be found below.

### Reboot device

```bash
sudo ./upgrade_tool rd
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="interactive" label="Interactive Mode">

If upgrade_tool is executed without any arguments, it will automatically enter interactive mode.

This mode will first ask to select the device to be written to:

```bash
$ sudo ./upgrade_tool
Using /home/rock/Linux_Upgrade_Tool/config.ini
Program Log will save in the /root/upgrade_tool/log/

## Parallel Write

Since upgrade_tool blocks the current terminal when writing to a device, if you need to write to multiple devices at the same time, you need to execute upgrade_tool multiple times to create multiple interactive mode sessions.
