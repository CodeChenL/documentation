## Backup via Script

:::danger
The backup script does not guarantee support for all unofficial systems. Please **backup important data** before use.
:::

We provide a script to backup your operating system into an **img** format image.

:::tip
This script has been thoroughly tested only on the official RuiShan systems.

This script does not support `Android` systems.
:::

The backup script allows you to back up the running operating system as well as perform offline backups.

### Installation

:::

Connect your installation media to your computer via USB or other means, and perform the following steps.

1. Mount the root partition of the files you need to back up to a specific path. This partition is the **last partition** on the current disk, see [Supported File Systems](#supported-file-systems) for details.

:::tip
The following operations are performed by default as the root user. Add the `sudo` command as needed.

Replace `ROOT_DIR` in the script with your actual path, such as: `/mnt/root` (you may need to create this directory using `mkdir /mnt/root`)

Replace `/dev/sdx3` with the actual partition path, such as: `/dev/sda3` (you can use the `lsblk` command to view partition information and replace it with the **last partition** of the current disk)
:::

```bash
ROOT_MOUNT_POINT=ROOT_DIR # Replace ROOT_DIR with your actual path
mount /dev/sdx3 $ROOT_MOUNT_POINT # Replace /dev/sdx3 with the actual partition path
```

2. Run the following command and follow the prompts. <InlineInfo> You usually need to rename the output file name, refer to [Backup to Specified Path](#backup-to-specified-path) for details. </InlineInfo>

```bash
sudo ./rockpi-backup.sh -m $ROOT_MOUNT_POINT
# sudo ./rockpi-backup.sh -m $ROOT_MOUNT_POINT -o xxx.img

### Backup to Specified Path

The backup script allows changing the location where the files are output. Simply add the `-o` parameter.

Command reference:

<Tabs groupId="method" queryString>
<TabItem value="online" label="Online Backup" default>

```bash
sudo ./rockpi-backup.sh -o xxx.img # Rename without changing the output location

sudo ./rockpi-backup.sh -o /mnt/sda1/ # Do not rename, change the output location

sudo ./rockpi-backup.sh -o /mnt/sda1/xxx.img # Rename and change the output location
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="offline" label="Offline Backup">

```bash
sudo ./rockpi-backup.sh -m $ROOT_MOUNT_POINT -o xxx.img # Rename without changing the output location

sudo ./rockpi-backup.sh -m $ROOT_MOUNT_POINT -o /mnt/sda1/ # Do not rename, change the output location

sudo ./rockpi-backup.sh -m $ROOT_MOUNT_POINT -o /mnt/sda1/xxx.img # Rename and change the output location
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
You can backup to external storage

Simply mount the external storage to a certain path, for example: `mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1`
:::

### Exclude Files

<Tabs groupId="method" queryString>
<TabItem value="online" label="Online Backup" default>

You can use one or more `-e` parameters to exclude files or directories. Please use **absolute paths**.

The generated image files are automatically excluded.

The script does not back up across file systems, i.e., it does not back up to the device you mounted, so you do not need to manually exclude mounted point folders.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="offline" label="Offline Backup">

You can use one or more `-e` parameters to exclude files or directories. Please use **absolute paths** relative to the root path **mount point**.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
The exclusion syntax of `-e` is the same as `rsync --exclude`.
:::

### Supported File Systems

If you are using an officially provided system, this script is usually supported.

If you modify the partitions, you need to meet the following conditions:
:::tip
If you meet the following conditions, unofficial systems can also be supported, including but not limited to `x86`, `arm`.

If you do not meet the following conditions, you can perform a [full disk backup using dd](#full-disk-backup-using-dd).
:::

:::caution
The size of the files you exclude is still counted towards your total image size. However, they will not be copied to the generated image. This would make calculating file sizes very complex.
:::

1. Hard disk format must be `GPT`

2. The system root partition should be at the end of the disk. (Sector 0 is the beginning)

3. Root partition file system should be `ext4`

4. Non-**disk encryption**

5. Non-**RAID**

6. Non-**LVM**

7. System services managed by **systemd**

## Full Disk Backup using dd

:::caution
This method only allows for **offline backups**.
:::

If your system to be backed up is installed on removable media.

:::info

1. [Off-board eMMC](https://radxa.com/products/accessories/emmc-module/)
   > Please use [eMMC reader](https://radxa.com/products/accessories/emmc-usb3-reader) to convert to USB
2. SD card
   > Please use an SD card reader to convert to USB
3. NVME
   > Please use an adapter to convert to USB
4. Others

:::

Connect your installation media to your computer via USB or other means, and perform the following steps.

```bash
dd if=/dev/sdx of=xxx.img bs=4M status=progress # Replace /dev/sdx with the actual device path, and replace xxx.img with the output file name
```

## Restore System

The file generated by the above method is a normal flashable image, and can be installed using conventional **system installation** methods.
