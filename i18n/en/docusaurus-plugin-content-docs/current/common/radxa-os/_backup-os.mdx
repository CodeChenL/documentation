## Backup via script

We provide a script to facilitate the backup of the system, which needs to be run on the board.

:::tip
This script is only fully tested on Radxa's official systems, and third-party systems using this script backup may not be successful.

1. Download script

```bash
wget https://github.com/radxa/backup-sh/raw/master/rockpi-backup.sh -O rockpi-backup.sh
```

2. View help

```bash
sudo ./rockpi-backup.sh -h
```

3. Backup image

以下命令假设我们把镜像镜像备份到 U 盘中，我们先挂载 U 盘，然后运行脚本的时候指定备份路径

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
sudo ./rockpi-backup.sh -o /mnt
```
