For faster access to the desktop, you can set the desktop to log you in automatically by modifying the `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` file.

```
sudo vim /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
Find [Seat:*] configured #autologin-user= ,modify this configuration to the user you need to log in as

[Seat:*]
...
autologin-user=radxa
autologin-user-timeout=0
...
```
