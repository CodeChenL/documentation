## SSH

This is a tutorial on how to access the board remotely from another computer using SSH.

1.  Check the SSH service status. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
sudo service ssh status
```

    If the SSH service is not installed, you can use the following command to install it:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ssh
```

    If the SSH service is not started or runs abnormally, run the following command to restart it:

```bash
sudo service sshd restart
```

2.  Open the terminal program and enter the following command:

```bash
ssh [username]@[IP address]  # or ssh [username]@[hostname]
```

    Example:

```bash
ssh radxa@192.168.2.100
```

3.  You need to enter the user password to successfully connect to the Debian system.
    This is a basic SSH connection process. You can use other SSH options for more advanced connections.

### View IP Address

#### View IP via Command

Open the terminal via `Ctrl + Alt + T`, enter the following command in the terminal to view the IP address

```bash
ip a
```

The IP address in the same network segment as the host is the IP address required for SSH connection, as shown in the following output `192.168.42.100` is the IP address we need:

```bash
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 56:ae:03:82:18:51 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 192.168.2.100/24 brd 192.168.2.255 scope global dynamic noprefixroute eth0
       valid_lft 43176sec preferred_lft 43176sec
    inet6 fe80::8e:d164:96ea:40b6/64 scope link noprefixroute
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

#### Find IP via Angryip

This method can be used to view the ip address when the SBC cannot be directly operated to obtain the ip address without a screen of remotely.

- First, the host PC needs to download [Angryip](https://angryip.org/download/), and then make sure the host PC and the board are in the same LAN.

- Open Angryip, select the IP range, the range is 192.168.2.0 - 192.168.2.255 (select the network segment where the host and SBC are located). Click Start, as shown in the picture.

- ![Angryip](/img/configuration/ssh-Angryip.webp)

- Ctrl + F Search `rock` keyword, find the IP address of the board.

## Remote Desktop - KDE Desktop

This is a tutorial on how to access your system remotely from a Windows computer using VNC.

### Installing VNC Server

1. Open the Terminal application and enter the following command to update the package list:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Enter the following command to install TigerVNC Server:

```bash
sudo apt-get install tigervnc-standale-server
```

3. Install the dbus-x11 dependencies to ensure proper connection to your VNC server:

```bash
sudo apt-get install dbus-x11
```

4. After installation complete the initial configuration of the VNC server, use the vncserver command to set the security password and create the initial configuration file:

```bash
vncserver
```

:::note
Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n Prompt for view-only password, it is recommended to select no and enter n, so that the remote can operate, not just watch, please according to their actual situation
:::

### Configure the VNC server

Once TigerVNC starts, it will create a VNC session with the IP address and port number of the VNC server (usually 5901), because to change the way the VNC server is configured, first stop the VNC server instance running on port 5901 with the following command:

```bash
vncserver -kill :1
```

2. Run the vncserver command to generate an xstartup in the ~/.vnc directory, if not, please create it manually and give it executable privileges:

```bash
touch ~/.vnc/xstartup
chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup
```

Edit the xstartup configuration file as follows:

```bash
radxa@rock-5b:~$ cat ~/.vnc/xstartup
#! /bin/sh
unset SESSION_MANAGER
unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
unset XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
xsetroot -solid grey
#vncconfig -iconic &
startkde &
```

3. After the configuration is edited, restart the VNC server:

```bash
vncserver -localhost no
```

4. View the VNC server:

```bash
vncserver -list

TigerVNC server sessions.
X DISPLAY # RFB PORT # PROCESS ID SERVER
:1 5901 2160 Xtigervnc
:2 5902 2872 Xtigervnc
```

5. Test the connection on the VNC viewer: On your Windows PC, open the VNC viewer, enter the IP address and port number of your product, and then authenticate using the user name and password of the VNC server.

### Installing the VNC viewer on your Windows PC

1. Go to the VNC Viewer download page on your web browser, e.g. https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/
2. Download and install the VNC viewer.

### Connection setup

1. On the VNC viewer, enter the IP address and port number of the product.
2. Use the user name and password of the VNC server to authenticate.
3. After successful connection, you can control remotely.
