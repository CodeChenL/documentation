# Open FydeOS

**FydeOS** is an operating system based on the open source project [Chromium OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChromiumOS),
which uses the Linux kernel and includes both a browser platform and container technology.
A platform with FydeOS installed supports the latest web application standards, is compatible with Android apps and the Linux environment,
and provides a user experience similar to that of a Chromebook.
